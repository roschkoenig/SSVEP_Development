For the time frequency analysis, the following steps were performed:

This is in file: SPM_1710
1. Convert each subject into time-frequency representations of the data
2. Average repeated trials by condition for each subject
3. Convert these averages into images
4. SPM analysis across a scalp (xy) by frequency 3D map to look for
   1. Main effect of Age (.05 FWE)
   2. Main effect of Stimulation (i.e. FG effect)
  
      Then, using the xy dimensions of the Stim cluster (across all frequencies)
      1. Main effect of BG
      2. Age x FG interaction
      3. Age x BG interaction
